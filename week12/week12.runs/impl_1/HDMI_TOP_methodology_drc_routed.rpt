There is a large setup violation of -9.373 ns between blue_reg[1]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and dvi_out/encode_ch0/o_tmds_reg[4]/D (clocked by clk_1x_pre). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#60 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -9.376 ns between blue_reg[1]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and dvi_out/encode_ch0/o_tmds_reg[5]/D (clocked by clk_1x_pre). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

There is a large setup violation of -9.381 ns between blue_reg[1]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and dvi_out/encode_ch0/o_tmds_reg[3]/D (clocked by clk_1x_pre). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
